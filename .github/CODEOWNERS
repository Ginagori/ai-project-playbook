# Archie — Core Soul Protection
# ANY change to core_soul.py or its hash requires team review.
# This is the immutable identity of the Playbook PM Agent.
#
# NOTE: Both team members share the @Ginagori account, so GitHub
# cannot enforce 2-person review. Real enforcement comes from:
#   1. Hardcoded SHA-256 hash in core_soul.py (runtime verification)
#   2. External hash in .github/core_soul.sha256 (CI verification)
#   3. GitHub Action: core-soul-integrity.yml (blocks mismatched hashes)
#   4. Pre-commit hook: scripts/pre-commit-core-soul.sh
